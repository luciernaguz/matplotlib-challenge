# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

The Goal: This reposity is to put in practice all about Plot with Python Matplotlib and Statistics.

 For this challenge its take me some time to try to doing correctly what they ask, It was confuse some Instructions but I think itÂ´s all complete.

  It was about to practice plot with a dataset that involves  a real scenario in science area, the first thing  was  clean the data, eliminate the duplicates and generate a Clean dataframe for the nexts tasks, then a preview analysis with a summary (mean,median,etc), next tasks were obtain the Regimen Drugs grouped using the Gender of the Mice, done the IQR and quantitatively for the  most promising treatment (taken from instructions) , for final take a specific Drug Regimen, a sample of that and doing more statistics.
  It was a huge learning for me this dataset show me it is possible  apply all I am learnig into real scenarios.
