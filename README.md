The Goal: This reposity is to put in practice all about Plot with Python Matplotlib and Statistics.

 For this challenge its take me some time to try to doing correctly what they ask, It was confuse some Instructions but I think itÂ´s all complete.

  It was about to practice plot with a dataset that involves  a real scenario in science area, the first thing It was  clean the info, eliminate the duplicates, doing at preview analysis, generate a clean dataframe, obtain the Regimen Drugs, took a look to what it is most promising treatment, also do a percentage about gender, and the most interesting a summary a simple statistics, for final take a specific Drug Regimen, a sample of that and doing more statistics.
